		<description>iCloud keeps your mail, documents, contacts and calendars up-to-date between your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Mac and Windows PC. 

With iCloud Drive, you can store any file in iCloud. Simply drag your documents into iCloud Drive folder on your PC and access them at any time, on any device.

iCloud Photo Sharing lets you share photos and videos with just the people you choose, and invite friends to add their own photos, videos and comments. My Photo Stream automatically downloads the most recent photos from your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch to your PC.

iCloud also keeps your Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Google Chrome bookmarks on Windows in sync with your Safari bookmarks.

Note: This package does not install Apple Software Update. This package does not successfully install on Windows Server because Apple does not support it.</description>
